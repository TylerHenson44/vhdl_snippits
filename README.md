# vhdl_snippits
VHDL Practice and small components. Trying to brush up on my VHDL knowledge from school. May work towards some other side projects.

## Snippets

### tutorial_led_blink
Tutorial project that blinks an led at different rates based on 3 switches

### display_test
Used to test 7-segment display. Displays 8-bit number on 7-segment display based on a given binary value from input switches.

### full_adder
Testing full adder implementation to be used as a component of a larger adder. Have not tested yet, so could be wrong.

### adder_32_bit *WIP*
32-bit ripple adder. Creating an adder component that could be used in a larger system. Will add 32-bits based upon given input, unsure where to get the input from. I may just connect the LSbs of the numbers to switches and display output to 7-segment. I also could run a Hopefully will be used in future processor creation endeavor.
